    Classes to collect results.
    
    The main methods of collecting results are:
    <ol>
      <li>From channel transmission, where {@link simulation.communications.channels.CommChannel} is encapsulated
	within ({@link simulation.communications.channels.ResultCommChannel}) which processes the transmission
	using {@link simulation.results.processors.ChannelResultProcessor}.</li>
      <li>From packet processors,  where the results can be processed via 
	{@link simulation.results.processors.ResultProcessor}
	<ul>
	  <li> by logging each reception using classes such as
	    {@link simulation.results.processors.TimedPktResultLogger}.</li>
	  
	</ul>
    </ol>
