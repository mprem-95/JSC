Classes to collect results.

The main methods of collecting results are:
<ol>
<li>From channel transmission, where {@link simulation.communications.channels.CommChannel} is encapsulated
	within ({@link simulation.communications.channels.ResultCommChannel}) which processes the transmission
	using {@link simulation.results.processors.ChannelResultProcessor}.</li>
<li>From packet processors, where the results can be processed 
	using {@link simulation.results.processors.ResultProcessor}.</li>
</ol>
